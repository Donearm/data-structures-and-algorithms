# Data Structures & Algorithms

A playground for data structures and algorithms

## Scope

The most common data structures and algorithms will be eventually covered in this repository. Ideally all in Python but Go and Javascript are planned too. The repository will slowly grow to encompass the full list of data structures and algorithms that I have in mind so be patient for the moment :)

## List of implementations

* Python
	* Linked Lists
		* [Linked Lists](algorithms/python/linkedlist/linked_list.py)
		* [Doubly Linked Lists](algorithms/python/linkedlist/doubly_linked_list.py)
	* Binary Search Trees
		* [Binary Search Trees](algorithms/python/bst/bst.py)


* Go
	* Linked Lists
		* [Linked Lists](algorithms/go/linkedlist/linked_list.go)
		* [Doubly Linked Lists](algorithms/go/doublylinkedlist/doubly_linked_list.go)
